Q(S,A,gamma,alpha) 
    Variables
    	S is a set of states 
        A is a set of actions 
        gamma the discount 
        alpha is learning rate 
    Local
    	real array Q[S,A] 
        previous state s 
        previous action a 
    initialize Q[S,A] arbitrarily 
    observe current state s 
    repeat
        select and carry out an action a 
        observe reward r and next state s' 
        Q[s,a] = Q[s,a] + alpha(r + gamma(max(a' Q[s',a'] - Q[s,a])))
        s = s' until termination
